    <p>Organized by CIET-NCERT in collaboration with CyberPeace Foundation</p>
    <p>Theme for November, 2022: Social Media - Safety and Wellbeing</p>

    <div class="section-title">What is Cyber Jaagrookta Diwas?</div>
    <p>The Ministry of Home Affairs is implementing a scheme called the"Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)" to deal with cyber crimes in a coordinated and comprehensive manner. In order to create awareness amongst students of schools & colleges, teachers and parents it is proposed to observe "Cyber Jaagrookta (Awareness) Diwas" on the first wednesday of every month in all Schools / Colleges / Universities/ Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) and Municipalities by involving District Magistrates Police Authorities, Officers of Education Department etc.</p>

    <div class="section-title">About the Theme</div>
    <p>For the month of November, 2022 CIET-NCERT in collaboration with CyberPeace Foundation has planned sessions on the theme "Social Media - Safety and Wellbeing". While addressing problems or creating security plans, it is frequently crucial to consider cyber security during the use of social media. In the present day, the internet has emerged as one of the main platforms for communication, with social media accounting for a significant amount of that usage. We all love to connect with our loved ones online with the help of social media. Social media not only helps us to connect but also helps us to collect and generate information. The amount of people using social media in India has been steadily increasing because of the widespread use of internet connectivity. This expansion has also been significantly promoted by the government-sponsored Digital India initiative. With this vast usage of social media, it is important that the users have adequate knowledge about the negative side of it. Cyberbullying, cyberstalking, sextortion, identity theft, etc are increasing and hence it is important for users to have adequate knowledge about safety measures.</p>
    <p>Four live interaction sessions will be conducted on the given theme, that is on the first Wednesday (i.e. 02/11/2022) & the subsequent Thursdays (i.e. 04/11/2022, 11/11/2022, & 18/11/2022). At the end of the session series, a comprehensive quiz will be launched based on all the sessions conducted in the month of November, 2022 on "Social Media - Safety and Wellbeing" as a part of Cyber Jaagrookta Diwas.</p>
