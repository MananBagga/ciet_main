                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4>Camera Unit</h4><br>
                Camera subdivision of MPD is headed by Mr. Anil Lonare. He is assisted by a team of Video Cameramen.<br>
                <h3>DUTIES  PERFORMED BY  CAMERAMEN</h3><br>
                A  Dynamics of moving picture or movable material has certain properties that the static shot lacks.Moving picture can depict change, one can modify the picture as the audience watches; altering subject prominence,redirecting attention introducing  or removing information , modifying the mood. The cameraman can convey directly the dynamics of movement, growth, development, etc. The moving picture offers continued interest unlike the still picture. The movement attracts. The camera movement provides continually changing stimuli.
The             Cameraman  attempts to assist the Director or T.V.Producer  to produce attractive significant pictures,that direct audience attention and influence their feelings about the subject and it's surrounding environment described in the script. The significant tools in the hands of the cameraman are Lens angle, lighting gadgets, track -trolley, small studio crane to create virtual sense of movement in the scene decided in advance at the planning stage of treatment of story line along with cameraman in realism.
                The cameraman creates the perspective &  dynamic movement in the scene with the help of following arrangements:-<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Composition by Design</li>
                    <li>Composition by Arrangement</li>
                    <li>Composition by Selection</li>
                    <li>Pictorial Balance</li>
                    <li>Visual Rhythm</li>
                    <li>Subject prominence</li>
                    <li>Unifying Interest</li>
                    <li>Picture Shape/Pictorial treatment</li>
                    <li>Composition Continuity in Multi Camera Production</li>
                    <li>The  Dynamic effects of Tone</li>
                </ul>
                The approach of the cameraman as an artist on a blank canvas  paints the picture with line, tone or color in any way he chooses with the limits prescribed in the story line or visual concept thoughtfully decided by the Director of the Film. A rough plan of the staging layout usually begins with drawing potential scale outlines of the settings including the main features - windows, doors, stairways etc. The Director's instructions concerning composition are indicative principally in terms of shot sizes or through a storyboard sketch showing the detailed composition of certain key shots. The Make-up person, Set Designer, Costume Designer/Wardrobe, Light-man  &  studio  lighting engineer  continuously  assists the Cameraman in creating the atmosphere required by the Director of the programe strictly in accordance with the story line.  Camera rehearsals as seen on camera, this treatment enables the Director &  Make-up artist to judge eventual detailed work and changes needed .<br>
                <h4>The Photo Unit</h4><br>
                The staff working in photo unit assists the council in recording activities &  news of Constituent Units of NCERT and CIET. The seminars , research workshops , Conferences, Sports events, cultural programs, still photography of T.V.Production activities is a round the year exercise conducted by Academic staff and  Media unit of CIET.
